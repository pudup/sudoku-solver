# sudoku-solver

It solves sudoku puzzles :>



## How to use

Download everything and run this command from the working folder

```python3 tkinterUI.py```


## Terminal version with visual solving output

Run this command


```python3 solver.py <optional-time>```

Replace time with any number which specifies how long in seconds the output will wait at each position. Reccommended 0.05. 0 is no visual

```python3 solver.py 0.05```


Using a visual drastically increases the time it takes for the program to finish solving the grid. Replace the example grid with an easy
version to avoid having to wait all day to see it go all the way through.
0.05 is a good balance between visual clarity and time to solve.
